        <h4>Less Walking</h4>

        <p>Too hot? Storming outside? No problem! With our app, you can now be picked up by another student who is in need of a parking spot. So not only does help them out, it saves you the long trek across campus.</p>

        <h4>More Parking</h4>
        <p>You don't need to circle around the parking lot 10 times just to find a spot or follow a person around just to find out they are getting something from their car and not actually leaving. Just connect with another student 
    leaving campus, pick them up, and you got yourself a hassle-free place to park your vehicle!</p>

        <h4>Happy Campus</h4>
        <p>We strive to provide a much-needed service to the Alumni and current students at the University of North Florida regarding parking. Our website gives the students the ability to assist each other in finding the best parking spot available while charging no fees to encourage engagement in the community</p>
